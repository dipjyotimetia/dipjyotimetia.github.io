### Caching solutions
* CACHE_ALL_STATIC (Automatically caches static content)
* USE_ORGIN_HEADERS (Required origin responses to set valid cache directives)
* FORCE_CACHE_ALL (Unconditioanlly caches all responses)

### Deploy and secure API services
* Google cloud endpoints(GCE)
    * User Authentication
    * API keys
    * Logging and monitoring

* Loosely coupled asynchronous application
* Graceful shutdown
  * The pod switches to terminating state and stops receiving any new traffic
  * preStop hook that is a special command or HTTP request is executed
  * SIGTERM signal is sent to the pod
  * Kubernetes wait for the pod to stop
  * SIGKILL signal is sent to the pod and the pod is removed
